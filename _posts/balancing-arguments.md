title: COMMA 2016 Proceedings; Formalizing Balancing Arguments
---

The [Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Computational
Models of
Arguments](http://ebooks.iospress.nl/volume/computational-models-of-argument-proceedings-of-comma-2016)
(COMMA 2016) are now available online, free-of-charge as open access,
from IOS Press.

The proceedings includes a paper Douglas Walton and I wrote about
a new formal model of structured argument, used in Version
4 of Carneades, with better support for balancing arguments,
cumulative arguments ("accrual"), and multi-criteria decision
analysis:

Gordon, Thomas F. and Walton, Douglas
(2016). [Formalizing Balancing Arguments](https://owncloud.fokus.fraunhofer.de/index.php/s/yllKhe3qliiHHRK). Proceedings
  of the 2016 conference on Computational Models of Argument (COMMA
  2016) (pp. 327-338): IOS Press.

Unfortunately, the [version of the paper in the
proceedings]((http://ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/45272) includes
a minor error in Definition 7 (Applicable Argument). The [version of
the paper available on my web
site](https://owncloud.fokus.fraunhofer.de/index.php/s/yllKhe3qliiHHRK)
corrects this error.
