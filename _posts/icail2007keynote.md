Occassionally I get asked for copies of the slides of my keynote
addess at the 2007 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence
and Law at Stanford University, with the title "20 Years of ICAIL â€“

and editable [OpenDocument](https://owncloud.fokus.fraunhofer.de/index.php/s/8kwKLYC4fwWuRsk) formats. (License: Creative Commons
